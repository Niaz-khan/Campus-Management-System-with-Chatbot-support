Got it! You want the **README.md** not only to document what exists but also to **clearly outline the remaining work and a roadmap with plans to complete the UMS**. Below is the **updated README with a detailed completion plan (phases)**.

{
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "admin123"
}
```

Would you like me to:

1. **Attach this README.md as a file (ready to use)?**
2. Or directly **replace your existing README.md with this (Django-ready)?**
3. Or both?
