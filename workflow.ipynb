    "# Campus management system\n",
    "Campus Management System (CMS) with an integrated chatbot makes for a smart and practical final-year project. It can serve administrators, faculty, and students, all in one platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI-Powered Campus Management System with Chatbot Support\n",
    "1. Introduction:\n",
    "Managing campus operations manually is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project aims to develop a web-based Campus Management System (CMS) integrated with an AI-powered chatbot assistant. The chatbot will answer queries related to attendance, exam dates, fees, and other student services using natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Objectives:\n",
    "- To provide a centralized system for managing students, faculty, courses, attendance, library, and fees.\n",
    "- To integrate a chatbot for assisting students and staff with queries.\n",
    "- To improve communication, automation, and efficiency across campus departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scope of the Project:\n",
    "- The system will cover:\n",
    "    - Student admission & management\n",
    "    - Faculty and course management\n",
    "    - Attendance and marks tracking\n",
    "    - Library module for book issuance\n",
    "    - Fee tracking and notifications\n",
    "    - Chatbot interaction for FAQs and support\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tools & Technologies:\n",
    "- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript\n",
    "- Backend: Django (Python)\n",
    "- Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL\n",
    "- Chatbot: Dialogflow / Rasa / OpenAI API\n",
    "- IDE: VS Code / PyCharm\n",
    "- Deployment: PythonAnywhere / Render / Railway\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Data Flow Diagram (DFD):\n",
    "- Level 0 (Context-Level DFD):\n",
    "    - Users interact with the system: Admin, Student, Faculty\n",
    "    - System accesses modules: Attendance, Course, Fee, Library, Chatbot\n",
    "- Level 1 DFD (for Student Module):\n",
    "    - Student logs in\n",
    "    - Views attendance, fee, and marks\n",
    "    - Interacts with chatbot for queries\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. System Architecture:\n",
    "- A three-tier architecture:\n",
    "    - Presentation Layer (Web interface)\n",
    "    - Application Layer (Django logic & Chatbot)\n",
    "    - Database Layer (PostgreSQL/MySQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Expected Outcomes:\n",
    "- A fully functional web-based CMS\n",
    "- A chatbot that understands and replies to common campus-related queries\n",
    "- Improved automation, efficiency, and student satisfaction\n",
