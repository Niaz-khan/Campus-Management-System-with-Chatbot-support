# üìë Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

**Project Name:** University Management System (UMS)
**Version:** 1.0
**Prepared By:** Niaz Khan
**Date:** September 2025

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the University Management System (UMS) is to provide a centralized platform to manage all academic, administrative, and student-related activities in a university. The system will automate processes such as admissions, course registration, exams, fees, attendance, hostel, transport, library, and communication through a single integrated system.

### 1.2 Scope

UMS will serve **Admins, Faculty, Students, Accountants, and Support Staff**. The system will:

* Manage academic operations (programs, batches, courses, exams).
* Handle student lifecycle from admission to alumni.
* Provide role-based dashboards and APIs.
* Integrate finance, hostel, transport, cafeteria, events, sports, and notifications.
* Ensure scalability, security, and usability.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

* **UMS** ‚Äì University Management System
* **DRF** ‚Äì Django REST Framework
* **JWT** ‚Äì JSON Web Token
* **API** ‚Äì Application Programming Interface
* **ERD** ‚Äì Entity Relationship Diagram

### 1.4 References

* IEEE 830 SRS Standard
* Django & DRF Documentation
* PostgreSQL Documentation

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

UMS is a modular web-based platform. Each functional area (students, exams, hostel, etc.) will be a separate Django app, integrated via APIs and PostgreSQL. React will serve as the frontend.

### 2.2 Product Functions

Key modules:

* User & Role Management
* Academic Programs & Courses
* Student Records & Enrollment
* Exams & Grading
* Attendance Tracking
* Fees & Payments
* Library System
* Hostel Management
* Transport Management
* Cafeteria Management
* Events & Sports
* Notifications & Communication
* Research & Alumni (future scope)

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

* **Admin:** Full control over the system.
* **Faculty:** Manage courses, attendance, marks.
* **Student:** View courses, results, notifications.
* **Accountant:** Manage fees, transactions.
* **Librarian/Hostel/Transport Officers:** Manage respective modules.

### 2.4 Operating Environment

* **Backend:** Django + DRF
* **Frontend:** React
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Task Queue:** Celery + Redis
* **Deployment:** Docker + Apache/Nginx
* **Hosting:** VPS (Hostinger/AWS)

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

* Must use **role-based access control**.
* Must support **API-first design**.
* Must follow **modular Django app architecture**.
* Must comply with **data privacy laws** (e.g., GDPR if applicable).

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

* Users have internet access.
* University staff trained to use the system.
* External dependencies: Email/SMS gateway for notifications, payment gateway integration for fees.
